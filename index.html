    <h1>How To Craft An Offer</h1>

    <h2>I. Pick the right market</h2>
    <p>&#9634; In Pain</p>
    <p>&#9634; Purchasing Power</p>
    <p>&#9634; Easy to Target</p>
    <p>&#9634; Growing</p>

    <h2>II. Pick a Niche</h2>
    <p>&#9634; Niche Down 3-4 Levels</p>
    <p>&#9634; Health→ Weight Loss→ Weight Loss for Women who just had kids→ Following Keto</p>
    <p>&#9634; Wealth→ Real Estate→ Flipping→ Without having to see a property all using DMs</p>
    <p>&#9634; Realtionships→ Dating→ Over 60→ Without awkward first dates</p>

    <h2>III. Charge What It’s Worth</h2>
    <p>&#9634; Be more expensive than everyone else (by enough that it causes consumer to pause)</p>
    <p>&#9634; High Price = Higher Value (wine example)</p>
    <p>&#9634; Higher prices get people better results (and are therefore ethical)</p>

    <h2>IV. Maximize Value Using Value Equation</h2>
    <p>&#9634; Maximize Dream Outcome (solve problem worth solving)</p>
    <p>&#9634; Maximize Perceived Likelihood of Success (testimonials & proven case studies)</p>
    <p>&#9634; Minimize Time to Success (How can we make this faster? How can we show progress?)</p>
    <p>&#9634; Minimize Effort & Sacrifice (How can we make this easier? More Seamless? Convenient?)</p>
