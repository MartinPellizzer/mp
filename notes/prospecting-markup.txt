### Plan Your Email

Mistakes To Avoid:

- when do they consume info?
- how familiar are they with you?

Plan:
- number of email to send?
- short and sweet? or more detailed?
- hard hitting? or soft?
- direct?
- standalone?
- part of an SPC campaign?
- nurturing? or action oriented?
- cross-platform?

Personalize:
- tailor the message to your audience
- know your client specific problems
- step into their shoes

Hook > Relate > Bridge > Ask

Relate:
- show you understand their problems (empathy)
[
    the COOs I work with tell me that
    the increasing complexity of the banking environment
    has made their job harder and more stressful than ever
]

Bridge:
- connect the dots between their problems and your solution.
- answer the question WIIFM?
- speak your prospect language.
[
    my team and I help people like you reduce complexity and stress
    with strategies to optimize growth and profit, mitigate credit risk,
    allocate resources effectively, and minimize regulatory surprises
]

Ask:
- ask, ask, ask
- be clear and ask them directly for something
[
  while I don't know if we are a good fit for your bank,
  why don't we schedule a short call to help me learn more about your unique challenges?
  from there we can decide if it makes sense to set up a deeper conversations
  how about next Thursday at 3:00pm?

Additional Notes:
- practice, practice, practice
- talk about them, not you
