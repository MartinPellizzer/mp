### practice, practice, practice
writing good messages is not easy. stop talking about yourself, step into your prospect shoes, speak their language.

### the best time to send emails
probably in the morning for B2B. write emails outside of the golden hours, and schedule them for the GH.

### pause before you press "send"
always proof-read your emails. no typo. take 10 minutes away and read it again.
