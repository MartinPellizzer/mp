# Fanatical prospecting
author: martin pellizzer
[notes about fanatical prospecting by jeb blount]

## intro
fan fact: superstars are the top 20% that produce 80% of sales.
successful people are fanatical and always prospect. they don't make excuses, whine, complain, live in fear, or procrastinate.
mantra: "one more call".
the number one reason for failure in sales is an empty pipe. not lack of talent, skills, or training.
harsh truth: there's no easy button. prospecting is hard and rejection-dense.

## mindset
mantra: today's champions are yesterday's ordinary people.

no need to reinvent the wheel. study successful people and find patterns. success leaves clues.
s: 7 core mindsets:
- optimistic: victim mindset is toxic
- competitive: a drive to win it all
- confident: approach prospect with self-control
- relentless: persistence always wins
- thirsty for knowledge: every opportunity teaches something
- systematic: near-robotic efficiency
- adaptive and Flexible: acute situational awareness

## To cold call or not to cold call
To not cold call is Fantasy Land.
To cold call without rejection is Fantasy Land.

### The fine art of interrupting
If you want succees, you've got to interrupt prospects.
No easy way. Don't wait them to reach you.

### Stop seeking the wasy way out and start interrupting and engaging
Interrupting is difficult and awkward. Anxiety.

### Just afraid to make the call - not cold call
Interrupting is not cold calling.
People fear interrupting, not cold calling.
Interrupt relentlessly to fill your pipeline.



## Adopt a balanced prospecting methodology
Use every possible channel. Use the phone even if you are not good with it.

### The fallacy of putting all your eggs in one basket
Don't invest in one thing only.

### Avoiding the lunacy of one size fits all
The foundation of a winning prospecting strategy is balance.
Use a mix of, telephone, in-person, e-mail, social selling, text messaging, referrals, networking, inbound leads, trade shows, and cold calling.
Test everything ans see what stick for your industry, or die.



## The more you prospect, the luckier you get
Fear can only conquered by action.
3 core laws of prospecting:
- the universal law of need
- the 30-day rule
- the law of replacement

### The universal law of need
When your pipeline is empty, you became needy and desperate.
The more you need something, the less likely you will get it.
When all your hopes rests on few prospects, the probability of failure increases exponentially.

### The 30-day rule
This rule is for B2B and high-end B2C.
The prospectinge you do in thiis 30-day period will pay off for the next 90 days.
Ignore it at your peril.

### The law of replacement
Constantly push new opportunities into the pipeline to replace those that will naturally fall out.
Do it at a rate that matches or exceeds your closing ratio (ie. 10% closing rate - add 10 new prospects).

### The anatomy of a sales slump
99% of sales slumps is because of lack of prospecting.
- you stop prospecting (30-day rule)
- you pipeline stalls (law of replacement)
- you stop closing deals
- you lose confidence
- you feel like a loser
- you lose motivation about prospecting
- you keep calling dead-end prospects
- you stall the pipe even more
- you look for silver bullets (law of need)
- you enter the black hole of misery

### The first rule of sales slumps
Commit to daily prospecting. Commit to daily goals.
Consistency beats talent and techniques.



## Know your numbers managing you ratio
Sales is a number game.

### Elite athletes know their numbers
Track everything. Reack peak performance.
- Efficiency: how much prospecting activity for time bloc
- Effectiveness: ratio between activity and outcome
Efficiency + Effectveness = Performance
Courage and self-discipline to track, analyze, and adjust.

### You cannot be delusional and successful at the same time
Track your number to avoid being delusional.



## The three ps tha are holding you back
procastination, perfectionism, paralysis from analysis

### Procastination
You can't compress one month of prospecting in one day
Prospect every day.

### Perfectionism
Perfectionism is highly correlated with fear of failure.

### Paralisys from analysis
The "what if" mantra is a sign of analysis = paralysis.

### Disrupting the 3Ps
Just focus on the next item on the list. Just focus on making one call. Just do it without double thought.



## Time, the great equalizer of sales
Time is the one constant.

### Adopt the CEO mindset
Adopt extreme ownership.
Find creative solutions to inevitable roadblocks.

### Protect the Golden Hours
In the golden hours, you prospect. Period.
Just say no to everyone. You are not paid for nonsale activity.
Prioritize. Get your priorities straight.
Delegate. Delegate nonsales task if you need. A virtual assistance may be good.
Daily mission: Squeeze as much out of the golden hours as possible. 

### The fine art of delegation
Delegating is how you scale yourself. Require trust of others. Give clear instructions to your support team. No one can read your mind. Follow up a lot. "In God we trust; everyone else, we follow up on". Respect your support team and say thank you.

### Blocking your time will transform your career
Block your time, focus on a single activity, and set an outcome goal.

### Horstman's Corollary
The law states: Work contract to fit into the time allowed. Schedule 3 "Power Hours" a day, no distraction allowed (no bathroom either).
Ex. Focus 1 hour to make 25-50 teleprospecting calls + 1 hour for email and social prospecting. In 60 days your pipeline wil be packed.

### Stick to your guns
Prospecting blocks are just appointments, you can't just leave. They are sacred. Put a "do not disturb" sign on the door. It is discipline, pure and simple. Hold yourself accountable.

### Concentrate your power
Multitasking is an illusion. The brain just cycle back and forth task very fast. But, ultimatelly, you suck at multitasking. Don't be delusional. Remove all distracions and focus on one activity at a time.

### Beware of the Ding
No email or phone notifications allowed. No buzz, ding, lights. 

### What lurks in your inbox can and will derail your sales day
Don't check email first thing in the morning. Block out the first one to two hours each day for focused telephone prospecting.

### Leverage the platinum hours
Every important nonselling activity is for platinum hours.
- build prospecting lists
- research
- precall planning
- developling proposal and presentations
- creating contracts and getting approval
- social selling activities
- email prospecting
- prospect research and call objective planning
- planning and organization
- administration and reports
- responding to email
- calendar management
- crm management

### Measure your worth
Law of triviality: The human tendency of wasting time on unimportant activities while mission-critical tasls are ignored. Don't waste time on low-value activities. Calculate your hour-worth and use that to pick worthy activities. This is effective time management.




## The four objectives of prospecting
Know your objective. Every time you call, know what to ask.
4 core prospective objectives:
- set an appointment
- gather information and qualify
- close a sale
- build familiarity

High-cost, high-risk, complex products goals:
- 1. get an appointment with qualifies decision maker
- 2. gather info
- 3. build familiarity

Low-cost, low-risk, transactional product goals (inside sales):
- 1. close the sale
- 2. gather info

Low-cost, low-risk, transactional product goals (outside sales, not in person):
- 1. get an appointment
- 2. gather info

Low-cost, low-risk, transactional product goals (outside sales, in person):
- 1. close the sale

Highly qualified database of prospects in your CRM:
- 1. get an appointment
- 2. build familiarity

New territory or start-up:
- 1. gather info
- 2. build familiarity

### Prospecting is a contact sport
Don't overcomplicate. Don't waste time on small talks. Ask what you want and move on. Set appointments, qualify, build familiarity, move into the sales process.

### Set an appointment
It's the most valuable activity. An appointment is a meeting thai is on your calendar and your prospect's calendar. Can be in person, phone, video call, web conference at a specific time and date. Not giving a time and date is not an appointment.

### Gather information and qualify
Don't waste time on ugly deals.
In the market:
- a small percentage will be qualified and ready to buy
- a large percentage will be qualified but not ready to buy
- a large percentage will be semi-qualified (find more info)
- a large percentage will be potential buyers
- a small percentage will never be buyers

Your goal is:
- set appointments to highly qualified and ready to buy prospects
- nurture highly qualified but not ready to buy prospects
- gather info on prospects you have incomplete data
- eliminate prospects who will never buy

Qualify first, then set an appointment. Alternatively, set an appointment first, then qualify.

### Define the strike zone
Develop a profile of a qualified prospect. Include optimal time to engage.

### Close the sale
If a one call close is possible, do it. Get past the initial pushback and objections and move them into a sales conversation.

### Build familiarity
You need:
- 1-3 touches to reengage an inactive customer
- 1-5 to engage a prospect who is in the buying window and familiar with you and your brand
- 3-10 if he is familiar with brand, but not in buying window
- 5-12 to engage a warm inbound lead
- 5-20 to engage a prospect who gas some familiarity with you and your brand, buying window dependent
- 20-50 to engage a cold prospect who does not know you or your brand
Increase familiarity.



## leveraging the prospecting pyramid
organizaion is everything. sort your list of prospects in a meaninful way. start calling those on top of the list, who are more likely to buy.

### walk like an egyptian: managing the prospecting pyramid
your prospect database should be a pyramid:
- for the prospects at the bottom of the pyramid: find more info and qualify
- higher up, if you have more info: identify buying window and potential stakeholders
- higher up, if potential buying windows identified: nurturing campaigns
- higher up, if large opportunities: regular touches, monitoring trigger events, building familiarity
- close to top, hot inbound leads and refferals: immediate follow-up to move it into the pipeline
- at the top, highly qualified prospects moving into the buying window: move them into to pipe
leverage the prospecting pyramid philosophy.

### powerful lists get powerful results
building effective lists requires consistency and discipline.
construct lists with the following filters:
- prospecting objectives: appointments, information, close, familiarity
- prospecting channels: phone, email, social, text, person, networking
- qualification level: highest qualified at the top, least qualified at the bottom
- potential: largest opportunities, lowest opportunities
- probability: likelihood of success top, lowest probability bottom
- territory plan: day of week, postal code, street, geographic grid, city
- inbound leads
- conquest prospects
- decision maker
- industry or market vertical
- costumers that purchase a specific type of product or service
- seasonal customers
- inactive customers
- leads from a recent trade show or conference

## own your database - why the crm is your most important sales tool
the database is your most important tool. the crm is important because:
- manage details without having to remember everything
- keeps you orgaized
- segment and sort prospect
- helps you qualify and move them up the prospecting pyramid
people forget fast. crm don't.

### own it like a ceo
apply the ceo mindset:
- be accountable for your crm
- proactively updating records
- take notes and log calls
- put new leads in the system
- don't whine, learn it through trial and error + online learning 
fanatical prospectors own thir database.

### a trash can or a gold mine
input call notes and update records. list decision makers, appointments, competitors, trigger events, buying window. it's like copleting a puzzle, it takes time.



## the law of familiarity
the more someone is familiar with you, the more it will return your calls. the less familiar, the more objections.

### prospecting lubrication
invest time in building familiarity, until you cross the familiarity threshold. crossing the threshold takes a lot of time and energy.

### the 5 levers of familiarity
- persistent and consistent prospecting
- referrals and introductions [customer, personal, professional]. to generate referrals, give a legendary customer experience, then ask [see script] 
- networking [events, conferences, trade shows]. ask clients what they attend. networking is the real social prospecting. talk about them and do not sell or set appointments. follow up after the event to achor them.

### company and brand familiarity
products for well-known companies are easier to sell than products for start-ups.

### personal branding
people buy you. you are the only person who can solve their problems. speak in public regularly.

### warning
balance building familiarity with prospecting. don't invest all your time to build familiarity.



## social selling
social selling is important. the 5 Cs of social selling:
- connecting
- content creation
- content curation
- conversion
- consistency

### social selling is not a panacea
conversion rates from phone and email dwarf conversion rates from social media.

### the social selling challenge
none

### social selling is not selling
don't pitch on social media (unless is personal inbox). use social media to build familiarity, to enrich the sales process. use social media for:
- social research, networking, lead generation, inboud marketing, prospecting, trigger-event monitoring, competitive intelligence, customer relationship management, account management,

### choosing the right social channels
social media can be time consuming or even exausting. focus on max 2. ask yourself on which channel you find your prospects. for most people linkedin is best.

### five objectives of social prospecting
beware of social media addictive power (likes, sahres, stars...).
used for:
- personal branding (building familiarity)
- inbound prospecting via education and insights
- trigger-event and buying-cycle awareness
- research and information gathering
- strategic prospecting campaigns
- outbound prospecting
efficient and effective are the name of the game.

### personal branding
- does my presence online support my efforts to build my reputation?
- am I positively building familiarity? 
avoid these mistakes:
- poorly written profiles
- incomplete and outdated profiles
- unprofessional photo or no photo
- extremely opinionated political or religious posting and discussions
- TMI - too much information about personal issues

### building familiarity
be present and consistently engage. like share, and comment. post relevant content, congratulate achievements, be present.

### inbound prospecting through insight and edivation
entice prospects to contact you. inbound leads are easier to convert. share and publish relevant content. share white papers, e-books, and reports that require prospects to enter contact info (maybe overt self-promotion).

### leveraging insight and edication to power up strategic prospecting
strategic prospecting campaigns (SPC) are long-term efforts to warm up and nurture contacts in anticipation for the buying window.
- decision maker and influencer mapping
- warming up and nurturing the right contacts
- identifying and developing relationships with potential coaches
- creating personal and brand familiarity
- generating goodwill and tapping into the law of reciprocity by offering value first
- getting invitent when the buying window opens.
you don't use SPCs with everyone. they are time consuming.

### trigger event and buying cycle awareness
trigger events open buying windows. some are predictable (budget or time), others not. stalk like a ninja on social media.

### research and information gathering
social media have massive data to plug into your CRM. use it to precall planning, develop prospecting messages, and map decision-makers.
[book - take the cold out of cold calling, sam richter]

### outbound prospecting
use social channel to ask for appintments or gather additional info. message them through the platform. many people include phone number and email addresses in profiles.

### the 5 Cs of social selling

#### connecting
send linkedin connection request. highiy successful people understand the power of connections. foot in the door of the right people faster. networking. everything on social media starts with a connection. send them a connection request right after you met them. your professional network is your most powerful selling tool. 
3 way to create connetions:
- direct: send a connetion request, if you already met the person mention something 
- reciprocal: follow x follow
- passive: publish/curate content and people will follow

#### content creation
create and publishing original content is powerful stuff, especially if it solves problems. build trust and credibility.
- articles
- videos
- slide presentation
- podcasts
- infographics
- white paper
- case studies
- ebooks
you become an expert. people will engage with you and your organization. you get insight into trigger events and buying windows. when people like, share, comment, you learn their problems.
creating high-quality content is powerful, but hard and time consuming. in bigger corporation you usually need permission to share insights.
it totally recommended that you create and publish original content. otherwise, curate.

#### content curation
educate, offer isight, solve problem. you become valuable and trusted. don't sell or self-promote. the message must be relevant and present. you must post every day. to keep it up, curate on top of posting original content. play the detective.
- awareness: what's happening in the industry? trends, competitors, and movers. discover and follow great leaders.
- intent: don't share random. create a theme. consume the content before publishing it, and add your comment and insightful takeaway.

## 14 message matters
there are no magic words. you need practice to craft impactful messages and to defy reflex responses, brush-offs, and objections.
prospecting is hard because you are interrupting, and intarrupting create resistance. ultimately, your words dictact either an incerease or decrease of resistance.
today, people are in constant stress, asking for their time is the most difficult part of the sale. don't freeze up on the first rejection and don't ask for thier time to talk about you company. you'll only increase their resistance.
people don't give away their time for:
- a feature dump
- a pitch about how awesome you are
- a list of facts and figures
- a marketing brochure
- info that's not relevant
- any mindless crap
no one wants to be pitched. it increases resistance. prospect don't feel listened and feel unimportant. they will resent you if you interrupt their day for that. yoru message must demonstrate a sincere intetrest in listening to them.
don't overcomplicate prospecting messages. their only goal is to quickly persuade your prospect to give you their time.

### what you say and how you say it
you have few seconds to grab attention. what you say, and how you say it, is critical. 
prospects sense your fear, weakness, lack of confidence. they will shut you down. delivery matters. be relaxed, confident, and enthusiastic. they will be more likely to open the door.
what matters:
- voice tone, inflection, pitch, and speed
- body langauage, facial expressions
- the way you dress and your outward appearence
- sentence structure, grammar, punctuation, and the words used in written communication

### enthusiasm and confidence
confidence and enthusiasm are the two most powerful and persuasive nonverbal messages. enthusiasm and confidence are not easy in the face of rejection, you need to develop techniques. change your facial expressions, words, self-talk, posture. this is not just a psychological response, is physiological. cortisol and testosterone. power posing.

### what you say
you don't need complicated scripts. prospecting is about persuading people to give you their time.
- be quick and right to the point
- be clear and transparent
- be relevant to their situation, problems, or issues.
being relevant is the most important part. ask for a 15 minutes discovery call, not a 1 hour long meeting. the lower the risk, the higher the chance they will give you their time.
[book - smart calling, art sobczak] find possible value propositions
[book - jill konrath, snap selling] find a clear statement of the tangible results a customer gets from using your product.
key parts to a winning value proposition:
- focuses on a business objective that is measured
- disrupts status quo: increase dales, reduced costs, improve efficiency, reduce stress... 
- offers proof or evidence: how much you have helped prospects in similar situations
the higher the level of the prospect, the higher the value proposition must have
[book - new sales simplified, mike weinberg]
your power statement must answer:
- the prospect's issues
- your offering that address these issues
- competitive differentiators
why they should do business with you (as a person)

### wiifm - the power of because
when you ask a favor to someone, provide a reason. don't overcomplicate, just give your prospect a reason to meet you. don't strive for perfect, just good enough. be quick, direct, and persuasive. not cheesy. craft a 10 seconds message. don't agonize over a perfectly crafted value propostition, just give them a "because".
ex. "I'd like 15 minutes of your time because I want to learn more about you and your company".

### bridging to the because
use their language to bridge their problems to your solution. because is a bridging word.
there are 2 types of bridges:
targeted: guess their problems based on assumptions, not research. blast many contacts in little time. the guesses are based on economic trends, experience in industry, competitor products. then you iterate and refine. 
ex. "hi bob, im martin from ozonogroup. im calling you because [set 15 appointments]. many clients have this problem. we solved it by using... with the following advantages [give number]. i have 2:00 pm on thursday open."
strategic: play detective. is time consuming so use it only for high-value prospects.
define what you're after:
- get more info?
- initial meeting?
- introduction to other person?
set google alerts for that company. review notes and history in CRM. press releases, linkedin, website.

### the secret to crafting powerful bridges
connect with emotions. frustration, anxiety, stress, fear, peace of mind.
before they give you time:
- emotional value
- curiosity value: most prospects worry about maintaining their competitive edge
- logic value: data and case studies
stand in your prospect's shoes. be empathic. talk their language.
tip: as yourself "so what?" on everything you say.

### ask for what you want
ask, ask, ask. don't beat around the bush with passive "maybe, if you want, one day, sometimes". there's no secret, no silver bullet, ask directly. you don't ask because you are afraid to hear "no".
1. ask with confidence and assume you will get what you want
2. shut up
3. be prepared to deal with reflex responses, brush-offs, and objections.

### assume you'll get what you want
statistically, assertive question get a positive response 70% of the time. nonassertive only 30%. that said, pair assertive with because.
[book - little red book of selling, jeffrey gitomer]
it all starts with positive self-talk. more assertive, more wins. more wins, more self-esteem. virtuous cycle.
words, voice tone, body language must be congruent. you must directly, quickly, and concisely get to the point.

#### voice tone and inflection and body language
when you face fear, the amygdala triggers (fight-or-flight). unfortunately, the amigdala doesn't distinguish real to fake threats. it shuts down your brain and pump energy to muscles. you must keep remembering the a "no" can't kill you. courage is like a muscle... the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets. keep calm and cool. fake your outside even if the inside is exploding. 
- no high pitch voice
- no fast speaking
- no tense or defensive tone
- no speaking too loud or soft
- no filler words or awkward pauses
- no looking away, more eye contact
- no hands in pockets
- no wild gesticulations
- no touching your face
- no hunched over, head down, arms crossed
- no feet movements
- no stiff posture, body tense
- no tense look on face
- no weak, linp, sweaty palm handshake

### shut up
find the strength to ask, and then shut up. the second after you ask it's hard to bear, but you must restit the urge to protect yourself. don't blab for nothing. don't let adrenaline mess up with you. don't self-sabotage.
the rule of thirds:
- get to yes fast: one-third of the time they say yes just because you asked. be super-efficient and move one.
- get to no fast: they say and mean no. this may also be a door slammed in your face.
- get to maybe fast: they will hesitate, put resistance or false objections. here you have a chance to convert into a yes with effective RBO turnarounds (handle reflexy responses, brush-offs, and onjections).
