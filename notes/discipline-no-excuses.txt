2. the expediency factor: lead people to failure and underachievement, no concern for the long-term consequences
you have and angel and a devil on your shoulder.

### take control of yourself
self-discipline is self-mastery.
to succeed, master your emotions, appetites, and inclinations.
if you can't master your appetites, you become weak, unreliable, and dissolute.

self-discipline is self-control.
control your actions, your words, and behaviours.
be consistent with your long-term goals and objectives, to be a superior person.

discipline is self-denial.
deny yourself the easy pleasures and the temptations that lead you astray.
do only the things that are right for the long term and appropriate for the moment.

self-discipline requires delayed gratification.
put off satisfaction in the short-term to enjoy greater reward int the long-term.

### think long term
success is directly correlated to long time perspective.
think about the long-term consequences for the present actions.
successful people are long-term thinkers.
think for the long-term, plan for the short-term.
long-term thinking applies to work, career, marriage, relationships, money, and personal conduct.
practice self-discipline all the time.
long-term equals sacrifice. sacrifice short-term for long-term.
prepare, study, and upgrade your skills. become more valuable for the future, not wasting time having fun now.

"Those heights by great men, won and kept,
Were not achieved by sudden flight.
But they, while their comanions slept,
Were toiling upward in the night."

### short-term gain can cause long-term pain
2 laws if you fail to practice self-discipline:
- law of unintended consequences 
- law of perverse consequences: a short-term action aimed at immediate gratification can lead to opposite consequences.
bad actions are far worse than not acting at all.

### the common denominator of success

look for pleasing results, not pleasing methods.
look for positive, long-term consequences of your behaviors, not personal enjoyment and immediate gratification.
be goal achieving, not tension relieving.
