# RESISTANCE

everything has resistance.
resistance is the opposition to electron flow in a circuit.
symbol R, measured in ohm, abbreviated with symbol omega,
most resistance: silver, copper, gold
resistance is affected by temperature (usually positively correlated)
resistance is affected by size (usually inversely correlated)
resistivity: silver 1.0, all others are in relation to silver
conductance: the ability of a material to pass electrons.
espressed in G, known as Mho, symbol is an upside-down omega, G=1/R

resistor: component design to have precise value of resitance
fixed resistor, variable resistor
tollerance: the amount of variation the resistor has
