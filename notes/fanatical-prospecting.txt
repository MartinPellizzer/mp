##### To cold call or not to cold call
To not cold call is Fantasy Land.
To cold call without rejection is Fantasy Land.

### The fine art of interrupting
If you want succees, you've got to interrupt prospects.
No easy way. Don't wait them to reach you.

### Stop seeking the wasy way out and start interrupting and engaging
Interrupting is difficult and awkward. Anxiety.

### Just afraid to make the call - not cold call
Interrupting is not cold calling.
People fear interrupting, not cold calling.
Interrupt relentlessly to fill your pipeline.



##### Adopt a balanced prospecting methodology
Use every possible channel. Use the phone even if you are not good with it.

### The fallacy of putting all your eggs in one basket
Don't invest in one thing only.

### Avoiding the lunacy of one size fits all
The foundation of a winning prospecting strategy is balance.
Use a mix of, telephone, in-person, e-mail, social selling, text messaging, referrals, networking, inbound leads, trade shows, and cold calling.
Test everything ans see what stick for your industry, or die.



##### The more you prospect, the luckier you get
Fear can only conquered by action.
3 core laws of prospecting:
- the universal law of need
- the 30-day rule
- the law of replacement

### The universal law of need
When your pipeline is empty, you became needy and desperate.
The more you need something, the less likely you will get it.
When all your hopes rests on few prospects, the probability of failure increases exponentially.

### The 30-day rule
This rule is for B2B and high-end B2C.
The prospectinge you do in thiis 30-day period will pay off for the next 90 days.
Ignore it at your peril.

### The law of replacement
Constantly push new opportunities into the pipeline to replace those that will naturally fall out.
Do it at a rate that matches or exceeds your closing ratio (ie. 10% closing rate - add 10 new prospects).

### The anatomy of a sales slump
99% of sales slumps is because of lack of prospecting.
- you stop prospecting (30-day rule)
- you pipeline stalls (law of replacement)
- you stop closing deals
- you lose confidence
- you feel like a loser
- you lose motivation about prospecting
- you keep calling dead-end prospects
- you stall the pipe even more
- you look for silver bullets (law of need)
- you enter the black hole of misery

### The first rule of sales slumps
Commit to daily prospecting. Commit to daily goals.
Consistency beats talent and techniques.



##### Know your numbers managing you ratio
Sales is a number game.

### Elite athletes know their numbers
Track everything. Reack peak performance.
- Efficiency: how much prospecting activity for time bloc
- Effectiveness: ratio between activity and outcome
Efficiency + Effectveness = Performance
Courage and self-discipline to track, analyze, and adjust.

### You cannot be delusional and successful at the same time
Track your number to avoid being delusional.



##### The three ps tha are holding you back
procastination, perfectionism, paralysis from analysis

### Procastination
You can't compress one month of prospecting in one day
Prospect every day.

### Perfectionism
Perfectionism is highly correlated with fear of failure.

### Paralisys from analysis
The "what if" mantra is a sign of analysis = paralysis.

### Disrupting the 3Ps
Just focus on the next item on the list. Just focus on making one call. Just do it without double thought.
